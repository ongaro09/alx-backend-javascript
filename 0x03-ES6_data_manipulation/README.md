## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

1. How to use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays.
2. Typed arrays.
3. The `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap` data structures.

## Requirements

1. **Execution Environment**: All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x.
2. **Allowed Editors**: You can use vi, vim, emacs, or Visual Studio Code.
3. **File Structure**: All your files should end with a new line. A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
4. **File Extensions**: Your code should use the `.js` extension.
5. **Testing**: Your code will be tested using Jest and the command `npm run test`.
6. **Linting**: Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint.
7. **Passing Tests and Linting**: Your code needs to pass all the tests and lint. You can verify the entire project by running `npm run full-test`.
8. **Function Export**: All of your functions must be exported.
